# front_lever

Personal project to (1) Check front lever form (hips too high/too low) (2) Track front lever progress (degree of tuck) via live video feed; Using OpenCV and Mediapipe to track right limbs

22/07/2024

I first had my lightbulb moment for this while I was training my front lever. Because you can't really see your hips position while holding a lever, I often struggled to tell if my form was good (i.e. hips parallel with shoulders). That limited my ability to self correct and train effectively.

I could only get real time feedback if someone was around to spot my form. But during self training that was not possible. Knowing what computer vision could do, I decided to use AI to help me form check and self correct in real time. 

While developing the program, I discovered an extra bonus. I could also measure hip angle, as a marker of progress from a tucked hip position to full open hip position.

That inspired me, that the potential of this was not just limited to levers. I could also check handstand line, track progress in front splits, etc. But for now, I shall keep my scope small.
